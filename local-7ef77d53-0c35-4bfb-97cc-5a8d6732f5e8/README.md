Play a classic Minesweeper variant rendered on an HTML5 Canvas grid. Left-click a cell to reveal it; a revealed number indicates how many adjacent mines surround that cell, while revealing a mine ends the game. Right-click to place a flag on suspected mines. Clear all non-mine cells to win. The interface is mouse-driven with a simple restart button and adjustable grid size for beginner to expert levels. The game uses minimal keyboard input and runs entirely in the browser canvas.
