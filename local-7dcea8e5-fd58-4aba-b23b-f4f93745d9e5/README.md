Peg Solitaire on a classic cross-shaped board. Jump a neighboring peg into an empty hole to remove the jumped peg, with the aim of leaving a single peg at the end. Use clicks to select a peg and then the destination hole; moves must be valid, and the puzzle provides a reset option. This is a pure solo gridâ€‘based puzzle that emphasizes planning and sequence of captures, implemented smoothly on Canvas.
