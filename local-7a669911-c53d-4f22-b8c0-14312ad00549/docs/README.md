Connect Four is a classic grid-based game where players drop colored tokens into a vertical 7x6 board. In this solo variant you play against a simple AI: click a column to drop your token; the AI responds with its own move. The goal is to connect four tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the AI does. The board uses mouse input for column selection and token placement, with clear visual feedback for valid moves and win conditions.
