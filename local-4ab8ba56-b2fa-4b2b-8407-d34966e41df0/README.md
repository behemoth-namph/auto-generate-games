Path Weaver is a grid-based puzzle where each cell hides a small pipe-like connector. The goal is to connect a continuous path from the Start (top-left) to the Goal (bottom-right) by rotating tiles. Click a tile to rotate its connectors 90 degrees; neighboring tiles must match edges to form a valid path. When the path from Start to Goal is fully connected, the level is solved. The board is drawn on an HTML5 canvas; use mouse clicks for rotation, with a Reset option to restart levels and a subtle hint system for guidance.
