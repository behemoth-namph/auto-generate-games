Six by six grid filled with colored gems. You swap two adjacent gems by clicking the first tile and then an adjacent tile to form a line of three or more of the same color horizontally or vertically. Matches disappear and gems above fall to fill gaps, with new gems spawning from the top. The objective is to reach a target score before running out of moves (for example 20 swaps). Interaction is mouse-based, using a two-click swap to trigger combos.
