Gem Swap Grid is a solo puzzle played on a 6x6 grid of colored gems. You swap any two adjacent gems by clicking one then dragging to the other; when three or more identical gems align in a row or column, they disappear, gems above fall down to fill gaps, and new gems spawn from the top. Chains score combos and increase difficulty; the objective is to clear a target number of gems within a fixed move limit or to reach a high score. No opponents are needed, so it is a pure puzzle experience rendered on HTML5 Canvas with simple mouse input.
