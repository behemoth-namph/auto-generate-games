Checkers on an 8x8 board features two colors of pieces that move diagonally and capture by jumping over opponents. You select a piece by clicking it, then click a valid destination to move; captures are automatic when available. The AI uses a basic rule set: force captures when possible and otherwise advance toward the opponent. The game ends when one side runs out of pieces or cannot move. Use simple mouse clicks to play and watch the board highlight legal moves.
