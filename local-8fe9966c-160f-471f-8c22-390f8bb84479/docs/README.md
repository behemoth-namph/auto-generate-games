Reversi, a grid strategy game on an 8x8 board, challenges you to outflank your opponent. You place discs to sandwich the opponentâ€™s discs between your own, flipping them to your color. In this HTML5 version you click to place a disc, the AI replies with a quick move, and turns continue until the board fills or no moves remain. The winner is whoever has the most discs when the board is full or no moves are possible.
