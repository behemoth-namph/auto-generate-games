Play on a 9x9 grid. You placement-block a pursuing token by clicking cells to toggle walls, aiming to trap it before it reaches the exit at bottom-right. After you place walls, press the AI Move area to advance the token by one step; the token moves to a neighboring cell that reduces Manhattan distance to the exit if possible, or stays if blocked. You win if you trap the token (no legal moves on its turn); you lose if it reaches the exit. Controls are mouse-based: click cells to toggle walls and use the AI Move control to progress the token.
