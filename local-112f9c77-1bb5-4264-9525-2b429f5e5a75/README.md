A classic grid-based puzzle played on a 4x4 board where you slide tiles to merge equal numbers. Use the arrow keys or mouse swipes to slide all tiles in a chosen direction; matching tiles merge into their sum and spawn a new tile on the board. The objective is to create a tile labeled 2048 while avoiding a full board with no legal moves. Controls are simple: click or drag on desktop, or swipe on touch devices; the board is rendered on HTML5 Canvas for smooth visuals.
