King's Grid Escape is a solo puzzle on an 8x8 grid where you guide a single King token to the bottom-right exit while avoiding a chasing enemy. Click an adjacent cell to move; after your move, the enemy advances one square toward you using simple Manhattan tracking. Static walls block movement, so plan routes carefully. If the enemy lands on your cell you lose; reach the glowing exit to win. The board, tokens, and walls are drawn on an HTML5 Canvas and supported by a minimal AI loop. Input is mouse-based only (click to move); a potential drag gesture can be added later but is optional.
