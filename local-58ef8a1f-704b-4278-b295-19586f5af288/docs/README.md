On an 8x8 grid, you guide a lone explorer from start to exit. Each turn you draw an action card from a small deck that can move you one cell, swap two adjacent tokens, or block a cell temporarily. You select a card by clicking it, then click a destination cell to apply it. An AI rival token moves toward the exit with a simple rule, adding pressure. The objective is to reach the exit first or trap the rival; use clear feedback to show legal moves and destinations. Controls are click-based with optional drag to reposition a card before play.
