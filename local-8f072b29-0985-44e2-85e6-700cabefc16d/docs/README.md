Play Reversi on an 8x8 board starting with four discs in the center. Each turn, place a disc on a valid square to flank one or more opposing discs; flanked discs flip color to your side. The game ends when no moves remain or the board is full; the player with more discs wins. Controls: click to place a disc on a valid square; an optional AI responds with a simple, efficient move selection.
