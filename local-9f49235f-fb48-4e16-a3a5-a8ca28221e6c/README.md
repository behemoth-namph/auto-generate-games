Starbound Rider challenges you to collect all glowing stars on a compact grid. The 6x6 board contains empty cells, blocked cells, and star cells. You move the single token by clicking an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right); stepping onto a star collects it. You must visit every star without stepping on blocked cells. Levels introduce more stars and obstacles, with a move counter and easy restart to promote quick, casual play on canvas.
