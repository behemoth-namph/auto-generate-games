A tiny solitaire-style puzzle on a 4x4 grid. Each cell starts with a card showing a rank from 1 to 4. Click a stack to pick it up, then click an adjacent cell to drop it, moving the entire stack. If you drop onto a stack with the same rank, they merge and disappear, awarding points. The aim is to clear the board within a fixed move limit (e.g., 24 moves). All input uses the mouse: click to pick up, click to place, and manage stacks across the grid.
