Card Grid Quest is a grid-based puzzle where a single token must collect scattered cards placed on a 6x6 board. Cards appear with simple symbols and a required collection order. You move by clicking adjacent cells or dragging the token along a row or column, collecting a card when you land on its cell. An optional AI rival mirrors your progress on a separate lane but uses a very simple rule set. Win by gathering all cards in order before time runs out.
