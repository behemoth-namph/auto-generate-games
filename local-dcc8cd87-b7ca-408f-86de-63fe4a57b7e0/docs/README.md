Lights Route is a compact Lights Out style puzzle on a 6x6 grid. Each cell hides a light that can be on or off. Clicking a cell toggles that cell and its four orthogonal neighbors. The goal is to switch all lights off. Start with a random pattern shown on the grid; use the mouse to click cells and observe the effect. Use the Reset button to replay from the starting pattern. When every cell is off, you win. The gameplay is intentionally simple, fast, and ideal for short sessions on HTML5 Canvas.
