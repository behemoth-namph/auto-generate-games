An 8x8 Checkers variant designed for solo play against a simple AI. The board is rendered on canvas with dark/light squares and circular tokens. You select a piece by clicking it, then click a legal destination to move or jump to capture. Kings can move backward once crowned at the far edge. The AI uses a basic greedy strategy focusing on captures and advancing pieces. The objective is to remove all enemy tokens or trap them through strategic moves, using straightforward click-to-move controls ideal for HTML5 Canvas.
