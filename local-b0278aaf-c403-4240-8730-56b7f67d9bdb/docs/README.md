On a 6x6 grid, tokens of several colors occupy cells with simple vertical drops as you mutate the board. You click two adjacent cells to swap their tokens; any horizontal or vertical line of three or more matching colors disappears, and new tokens flow in from the top to fill gaps. The goal is to reach a target score within a fixed number of moves in a solo puzzle mode. The game uses a grid, movable tokens and a clear drag/click input for swaps, designed for HTML5 Canvas.
