Classic Othello on an 8x8 board with discs that flip when you sandwich opponent's pieces between your newly placed piece and another of yours. Click to place a disc; the game automatically flips affected discs and updates the board. The simple AI evaluates mobility and potential flips to choose a move. The objective is to have the most discs when the board is full or when no moves remain.
